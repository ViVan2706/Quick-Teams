# Quick Teams

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Description

**Quick Teams** is a platform that helps people form the most compatible teams for hackathons, projects, and collaborations. Instead of just filtering by skills, our platform uses **advanced smart-matching algorithms** that take into account skills, hobbies, personality traits, and working styles. This ensures that teams are not only capable but also balanced, collaborative, and high-performing.  

With Quick Teams, all your team requests and participation options are organized in **one place**, making it easier than ever to manage, track, and join teams.

### Core Features

1. **Create Team Request**  
   Users can create a new team by defining its purpose, required skills, team size, and description.

2. **Join Team Request**  
   Users can browse or get recommended teams based on our smart-matching algorithm. Quick Teams suggests the **best matches**, going beyond simple skill matching to ensure compatibility and collaboration.

3. **Status Tracking**  
   Each team request shows who has joined, current team size, and whether the team is full. This provides transparent tracking of participation and team growth.

In short, Quick Teams provides a **smarter, centralized way to organize and join teams**, focusing on compatibility and collaboration instead of just filtering skills.
